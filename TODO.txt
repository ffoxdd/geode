- [ ] Add unit tests around basic triangulation objects
- [ ] Rewrite Matrix#det since the sub-matrix probably ruins the performance
- [ ] Switch from spec to normal tests so you can use more language features
- [ ] See if it's possible to write fast determinant code with macros
- [ ] See if it's possible to profile the compiled code for fast classes
- [ ] Move Vector3.from_spherical_coordinates/random (a vector doesn't need to know where it's embedded)
